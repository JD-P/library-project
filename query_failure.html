    <h1> How to use the library search: </h1>
    <h2> Search by availability accepts the following terms: </h2>
      <p> True, true, 1 <br> False, false, 0 </p>
    <h2> The difference between partial and exact matching search: </h2>
      <p> A partial match means that when you search any results that *contain* your <br>
      query will be returned. For example if you search by author for 'Isaac' you <br>
      will get any author named Isaac such as Isaac Asimov. By contrast, if you <br>
      do an exact match for Isaac you will recieve few or no results because Isaac <br>
      is only a first name and the author field usually includes two.

    <h2> How to save the results of a book lookup: </h2>
        <p> Right click on the background of the page and use the option "save page as". <br>
	On mobile there should be a a similar option that varies in location based on what <br>
	phone you are using and what web browser.
